Version 2.4.0
2013-04-03	André Offrnga <of...nga@gmail.com>

This version took longer than usual, but this is reflected by many large changes, most prominently: improved (full!) E/JVLA compatibility due to multi-SPW and multi-field support, improved Parkes compatibility due to SDFITS fixes, automatic loading of a strategy that matches the telescope and observation properties and switching between plots in the RFIGui.

Full list of changes:

* Added a simple Parkes strategy ([tickets:#19]) -- not extensively optimized, but seems to do a reasonable job (...much better than simple thresholding)

* Measurement sets with multiple spectral windows are now fully supported ([tickets:#11]). All reading modes will correctly read and write such measurement sets.

* Measurement sets with multiple fields are now fully supported ([tickets:#18]). This and the previous feature has been requested many times, in particular to be able to easily flag JVLA data without 'split()'-ting off the bands or sources. As with the previous feature, all reading modes will now correctly read and write multi-field measurement sets. Each sequence of correlations on a single source will be flagged individually. Thanks to R. van Weeren for providing test sets.

* The RFIGui and aoflagger, when not specified otherwise, will now load an optimized strategy when an observation is opened. ([tickets:#10]) Telescopes for which this is currently supported are LOFAR, MWA, Parkes, JVLA (beta) and WSRT. In other cases, a "generic" strategy is loaded, which is the LOFAR strategy (which is actually not very generic -- I hope to improve that in the next version).

* An initial JVLA strategy was added, that I've optimized for a ~1.1 GHz observation that I've received from R. van Weeren. Together with the other 3 previous features, this allows to simply execute "aoflagger my_jvla_set.ms" on a standard JVLA multi-source/spw file and get good results (if your sets look like the set I got) without any further tweaking. If you have, send me "typical" observations of other frequencies so I can optimize this further.

* The default WSRT strategy has been tweaked.

* The strategy wizard has been improved: a "fast" option was added and the sensitivity can be changed. ([tickets:#12])

* The plotting window in the RFIGui now shows a list of all previous plots, which can be quickly reselected and its style can be changed ([tickets:#9])

* The main window in the rfigui now shows the selected correlation name (e.g. RT0 x RT1). Can also be turned off and/or changed. ([tickets:#8])

* The aoflagger console application will now automatically select the optimal number of threads when not overriden on cmd line ([tickets:#6])

* The indirect reader has been made a lot more efficient. It will "preallocate" the files it will write (if [your filesystem supports it](http://linux.die.net/man/1/fallocate)) and will no longer create a file for every correlation, but rather uses only one for data and one for flags. This overcomes problems with "too many open files" on some environments.

* When properly installed, the RFIGui and aoqplot applications will have a application/taskbar icon and show up in the menu of common desktop environments. ([tickets:#14])

* Toolbar has been cleaned up, the more commonly used buttons are now there & some icons were added. ([tickets:#13])

* Several menu items now got accelerator key, e.g. "F9" is "run strategy".

* Bugfix: G van Diepen send me a patch to fix variable length arrays and class/struct mixing, which caused problems on the Mac.

* Bugfix: Fixed a bug in the SDFITS reader/writer. With some help from J. Delhaize, this version is able to open and flag Parkes SDFITS file both with the RFIGui and the aoflagger console application. ([tickets:#21])

* Bugfix: MWA strategy could silently fail

* Bugfix: aoqplot will ask for filename if none given ([tickets:#22])

* Bugfix: Deadlock when showing error dialog box during execution of strategy

* Bugfix: fixing rare bug in RFIGui when a set contains invalid times

* Refactoring: The main RFIGUI class is huge, major efforts to clean it up and split some things in new classes in a model-view-control way.

Version 2.3.0
2012-12-16	André Offringa <of...nga@mso.anu.edu.au>

Summary: A wizzard for creating strategies & solved compilation issues under Ubuntu

Full list of changes:

* Fixing Ubuntu compilation error reported by A. Chippendale, D. Jacobs, R. Wayth and O. Smirnov. Ubuntu seems to use a different linker (~configuration?) than other Linux distributions, which causes the order of libraries that are linked to matter. The flagger should now also compile fine on Ubuntu 11-13.

* The AOFlagger now knows how to create custom strategies with certain modifications, that can be specified in a small wizzard window in the GUI. Some modifications include making the strategy more or less sensitive, making it insensitive for transient effects, making it more robust and being more aware of off-axis sources. The default strategy inside the GUI is slightly changed, which I think alows better experimenting for generic cases.

* Test suite is now again working (seems to have been broken in the transfer to new repository structure)

* It is now possible to open a png file inside the rfigui.

* Slight performance improvements to quality stat collector.

* Bug fix: VDS files (remote obs specifiers) could not be opened after the new repository structure.

* Bug fix: Added support for custom CFITSIO directory.

* Bug fix: Some supported GTKMM versions gave compilation errors (reported by M. Loose).

Version 2.2.0
2012-11-10	André Offringa <of...nga@mso.anu.edu.au>

Summary: The AOFlagger was moved to a new repository, an API + docs were added, performance was (again :-)) improvement.

Full list of changes:

* Major repository restructing and moved to SourceForge!
Many thanks to the LOFAR developers for hosting my project for so long in the LOFAR daily build, but it was time to separate the AOFlagger sources from LOFAR. This means the source structure is now much simpler, the project compiles faster and it is easier for me to package. Moreover, anyone can now enjoy the latest fixes by using the public SourceForge git repository. Sources are still published under the GPL version 3 license.

* Official site is now http://aoflagger.sourceforge.net/.

* The "rficonsole" executable has been renamed to "aoflagger". For the time being, a placeholder will warn you about the new name.

* The software is no longer depending on the log4cpp library (this used to be required for the LOFAR infrastructure).

* Faster high-pass filtering algorithm using SSE instructions, which has replaced the sliding window algorithm in the default algorithm (3 x filtering, 10% benefit in full strategy).

* New reading mode that reads a full set in memory. It is 25% faster compared to indirect when every thing fits in memory (on a 1gb set: Direct: 2m53, Indirect: 1m55, Memory: 1m27). This is now the default reading mode when enough memory is available.

* New public API. This API exposes a few simple & documented interface classes in a single header, that can be used to integrate the flagger and/or quality collector in an observatory's pipeline. It is used by the Cotter MWA preprocessing pipeline and will hopefully be used by LOFAR's preprocessing pipeline (NDPPP) some time in the future. Latest API docs can be found here: http://aoflagger.sourceforge.net/doc/api

* New feature: action that can preliminary calibrate the passband (used in default MWA strategy)

* Bug fix: conversion from XX,YY to Stokes U did not work when no XY,YX polarization were available, as well as some other uncommon conversions.

* Bug fix: allow inverted vertical axes in plots, as well as some other plotting fixes.

* Bug fix: sdfits reader did not read polarizations properly.

* Bug fix: uvfits reader could not open MWA fits files properly.

* Bug fix: various uncommon crashes in rfigui.

* Bug fix: on opening measurement sets, option window now always opens on top.

* Bug fix: cmake will now fail when gtkmm version < 2.18.

* Bug fix: fixing problem reported by K. Buckley, which caused compilation errors with older (2.10) gtkmms.

* Bug fix: clarified some error messages in rfigui.

Version 2.1.0
2012-08-12  André Offringa <of...nga@astro.rug.nl>
  * This release adds support for .sdfits files that are used in Parkes data reduction and has various little enhancements. Strategy file format has not changed.

  * Enhancement: more options for aoquality tool.
  * Bug fix: The uvfits reader did not work any more on WSRT files because of architectural changes in the AOFlagger. Fixed.
  * Bug fix: AOFlagger can now flag data without time stamps (wich allows me to flag data from my personal hobby telescope).

  * Performance enhancement: Improved speed of horizontal sumthreshold algorithm with SSE instructions, leading to about 10\% improved speed on overal strategy.
  * Bug fix: fixed bug in previously mentioned new SumThreshold algorithm causing crashes (reported by J. Swinbank), also adding test case to validate result.
  * Performance enhancement: Improved performance of reading meta data of measurement sets.
  * Experimental additions: the frequency filters are now optimized and can be applied on huge (LOFAR) observations.
