The quick summary to compile and install, from the aoflagger root directory:

mkdir build
cd build/
cmake ../
make (or make -j <thread count>)
sudo make install

This will normally work when you have installed all libraries in their default locations. If you have not done so, you might need to tell cmake where the libraries are. The easiest way to do this is by adding search paths to cmake, e.g.:

cmake ../ -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/cep/casacore/

This will include /opt/cep/casacore to the search path. Multiple paths can be specified by separating them with a colon ':'.
